Description: A two-step procedure presented in Gianola et al. (2010). is implemented for analysis of FST statistics obtained for a battery of loci,
which eventually leads to a clustered structure of values. The first step uses a simple Bayesian model
for drawing samples from posterior distributions of tetha-parameters, but without constructing Markov
chains. This step assigns a weakly informative prior to allelic frequencies and does not make any
assumptions about evolutionary models. The second step regards samples from these posterior
distributions as ‘data’ and fits a sequence of finite mixture models, with the aim of identifying
clusters of tetha-statistics.
