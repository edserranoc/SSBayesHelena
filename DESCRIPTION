Description: Performs the two-step approach for detecting selection signatures using genomic data from diploid individuals and biallelic markers developed by Gianola et al. (2010) and modifications to perform inference based on the Laplace approximation and to incorporate pedigree information using the likelihood derived by Martínez et al. (2017).
